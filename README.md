# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview

This project presents the user with a list of restaurants along with a map detailing the restaurant locations. The restaurant's details can be viewd by selecting the `View Details` button or by clicking the restaurant's pin on the map.

Offline support is provided using the service worker API.

## Running the application

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

\* This is only a recommendation, if you have another way to serve http requests locally feel free to use it.
